# Crop-Prediction-using-Machine_Learning
Mini project 

Data model which will provide probability of growing a crop at given temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
We have created a model for 3 crops (Rice, Wheat, Cotton).
This is an data model being developed for the purpose of helping the farmers to choose the crops leading to high yeild.

This model uses datasets of three kinds:
Regional yield and economy of crops,
Soil profile,
Favourable weather conditions.

Incorporating these data sets we aim to predict the most economically favourable crop cultivation.
